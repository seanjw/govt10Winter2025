## Observational Causal Designs: The Limits of Randomization
- Randomization is the best available tool for sorting out the difference between causation and correlation. \pause
- In many cases, randomization is unethical or just not feasible: \pause
	+ **What is the effect of acquiring nuclear weapons on international trade policy?** \pause
	+ **How does indiscriminate violence affect insurgency?** \pause
	+ **How do economic crises affect support for incumbents?**
	
## The Limits of Randomization
- These questions may still be answerable---with less precision \pause
- If we observe what happens in the world, and try to draw inferences from it. \pause This is known as an observational study \pause
- An examaple where we cannot randomize!

## A Good Observational Study

- To increase confidence, we need to rule out **confounders** \pause

\begin{center}
Return: Does shaking hands with a presidential candidate at a rally increase the chances a person will vote in the election? \end{center}

## Subclassification

- One way to limit the influence of confounders is to narrow the study to *focus on similar participants* \pause

![](Images/flowchart2.png)
\pause

- We can construct a control group that looks similar to the treatment group by gathering data on people who attended rallies but did not shake hands.

\pause
\begin{center}
$Avg_{Enthusiastic\:Handshake}$ = $Avg_{Enthusiastic\:No\:Handshake}$  \end{center}

## Longitudinal Studies

- Another approach is to leverage time \pause

\pause


- In order to know the effect of contact for Group 1, we need to know not only the average turnout rate \textcolor{red}{after}  the handshake, but the average turnout rate \textcolor{red}{before} (prior elections)
\pause
\begin{center}
Effect of Hand Shake  =  $Turnout_{After}$ – $Turnout_{Before}$  \end{center}

## We want to observe behavior before the handshake

## What is the effect of a handshake?
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{}           & \textbf{Increase}            & \textbf{Voted} \\ \hline
\textbf{Hand shakers:} & 10\% Increase           & 55\%            \\ \hline
\textbf{Non shakers:}  & 3\% Increase (Control)   & 43\%            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Difference-in-Differences Estimator
Average Treatment Effect:


\pause
Avg($Y_{Treatment\:Group}$) - Avg($Y_{Control\:Group}$) 
\pause
 
Difference-in-Differences:  


Avg($Y_{Treatment,Post}$ - $Y_{Treatment,Pre}$) - Avg($Y_{Control,Post}$ - $Y_{Control,Pre}$) 




\pause

(55% - 45%) – (43% - 40%) = *7% ~ Treatment Effect*

\pause
&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3%

## Difference-in-Differences Estimator

“Differencing” controls for unobserved **secular time trends** (general tendencies)
\pause

- In this case, something that would make people more or less likely to vote, independent of the handshake: \pause

	+ The economy \pause
	+ A political scandal \pause

- Key assumption: the treatment and control groups will behave similarly over time. \pause
	+ Each group may have a different baseline propensity to vote \pause
	+ However, we should observe parallel trends over time
